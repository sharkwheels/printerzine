The anger, the pain.

┼┼┼┼ THE ANGER ┼┼┼┼┼

Ren is silent for a while, his voice quiet.

The pain is so intense that it makes him feel like he is in the middle of the desert.

He feels as if he is in a cave. 

His heart is broken, his soul is broken.

He has no way out of this. 

His life is a lie. 

The sound of the snow. 

The wind. 

The cold, the sound of ice.

("Barb", """Kylo looks up at Hux, his smile still wide, and his hands still on his hips.

He started to think about what was wrong with him, and what he needed to do.

And then he realized what was wrong.

"I think you're crazy," Ren said.

He looks down at his hands, his face still a mixture of shock and amusement. 

"I think its because you're so stupid," Hux said.

Kylo's eyes widen, his face a mixture of confusion as he tries to keep his composure.

("Master","""Ren, who had been waiting for him in the corner, had now turned his face away from the darkness. 

He had felt Ren's presence, the way Ren's heart was, and the way Ren had seen him, the one who was always with him.

« You are not the one I have been waiting for »

The darkness swallows Ren's face, and he feels his body trembling, his heart beating.

« It's not like I can help you »

He has to say it, but it is hard to say.

He cannot believe it now.

« But it is true »

« You will never be able to understand what I am thinking »

« But you will always understand what I have seen »"""),

("Impatient",""""Oh Ren," Hux groans, "I don't want to do this~~~" 

Hux's eyes widen, and Ren stares at him with a look of disappointment.

"I don't care if you do or not, but it's going to hurt if you don't."

Ren pulls Hux away with a smile that is not as serious as he would like to admit. 

"I can't wait to see how much of you I get out of this," he says, as his hand moves up and down Hux's body.

Ren is not sure how much longer he can wait.

("Meditation","""Ren's mind is a blank slate filled with empty thoughts. 

And the blackness of his mind begins to fill up.

The blackness of his mind fades.

And yet, he does not come out.

He is a man who has died. 

He is a man with the knowledge that he is the only one who can stop this. 

He is a man who is a man with the knowledge that he is the only one who can stop this.

The man in the mask was still there, but now his eyes were gone. 

His face had become more human, more alive, less lifeless.

It was only now that the man was gone that the smile on his face became genuine.

("Ren In A Way","""It was a time that had been a blur between them.

And it had been a blur of fear between them.

The fear that Ren had had that day and the fear that Ren had not been alone.

Ren was terrified of something. 

Fear that he would not survive in the future.

The fearful fear had been Ren in a way, Ren in a way.

The fear that Ren had had that day and the fear that he did not know the answer.

Fear that he did not have the time to find a way to find a way out.

Fear that he did not have the courage to leave his mother. 

Fear that he did not want to be alone.

Fear that he did not have the strength to be alone.

Fear that he did not have the courage to leave his mother.

Fear that he did not have the strength to stand in front of his mother.

("The Wall", """

This was to help Ren understand that his life is more important than his body, that he's more than just a piece of meat. 

That he can't just let his body be taken over or he will never get back to it.

"I'm not sure if we'll ever get to that," Ren says. 

He is not quite ready to let go of the wall, but he is not quite done yet.

"I know you can, I know you're going to have to make that choice," Hux says softly.

"I know you can, but I can't," Ren says, his voice quiet, "I'm not ready to go back to my own body and be satisfied with it."

"I'm sorry, Hux."

I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
